    "    To solve this problem, I will use exclusively python 3.7.3 without any additional library.\n",
    "##### Defining the base functions\n",
    "    Before answer any question I will create three main functions:\n",
    "    1- consumption(n): the consumption function computes the consumption given n as input, where n is income.\n",
    "    *I used an anonymous function to simplify.\n",
    "    2- incometax(n): the incometax function computes the income tax given n as input, where n is income. \n",
    "    *This function uses recursion to work.\n",
    "    3- ginindex(n): the ginindex function computes the Gini coefficient given n as input, where n is an array of real positive numbers.\n",
    "    *This function uses a subfunction called added to help itself.\n"
